I'm using this page to track my Cantonese language learning progress, both as a
way to stay motivated and as a way to allow those of you following my progress
to keep track of where I'm at.

Language learning consists of four primary skills - listening, reading,
speaking, and writing. Currently I am focused primarily on listening and
reading, and I am tracking my progress against the following materials:
