Now that we are a few weeks into the new year, I thought it would be a good time
to reflect on what I achieved in my Cantonese studying over the course of the
last year, and to set my intention for 2021.

## 2020 In Review

If I were to summarize the goal of the last year's worth of study, it would be
to develop basic Cantonese competency, and to improve my studying methodology.

### Material Studied

This past year, I spent most of my active studying time on reading and listening
to learner level material, including:

- Teach Yourself Cantonese
- all Cantonese Learning Centre website material
- two Greenwood Press learner books
  - Listening To Cantonese Basic Skills
  - A Fung Shui Master
- Olly Richards Cantonese Conversations dialogues
- Remembering the Hanzi 1 character book

### Changes in Studying Methodology

I made a few changes to my study habits in 2020 which I think have helped. Most
of these changes came as a result of looking at what methods others have used
effectively rather than my own discoveries. They include:

- started learning characters for real; transitioned from "guessing" to reading
  when looking at written Chinese. This includes beginning to develop the skill
  of quickly discerning constituent parts that a more complex character is
  comprised of
- started creating flashcards exclusively from sample sentences, rather than
  individual words. Vocabulary sticks better when learned in context rather than
  in isolation
- started a habit of passively listening to Cantonese while working

## 2021 Goals

The theme for 2021 is "comprehension". I will again be focusing primarily on
lots and lots of reading and listening, with a bit of new character study. At a
high level, my goals include:

- complete all remaining learner material in my possession
  - Storybooks Canada Stories
  - Living Cantonese
  - Cantolounge Transcripts
  - Cantonese Academy dialogues
  - How To Study Cantonese Children's Stories
- complete Remembering Traditional Hanzi 2, resulting in a total of 3000
  characters studied across 2020 and 2021
- transition to using native television and movie content as a primary means of
  active study and sentence mining

I also would like to read my first native Cantonese book. I have a copy of the
Little Prince in Cantonese, which I believe is also one of the only full length
books to have ever been produced using written Cantonese characters rather than
standard Chinese; super cool.

Regarding listening comprehension, my level is still quite low; I can tell when
listening to native content on YouTube that I probably understand something like
20% of what is being said. I would love to bump that up as high as I can this
year. To achieve this, in addition to studying the learner material above, I
plan to begin actively listening to native content every day in addition to the
passive listening I already do. This will mostly take the form of watching an
episode or two of a show most days, as well as the occasional movie. Once I
complete the learner material, I will also use this active listening/watching
time to sentence mine.

Although I don't plan on focusing on extensive speaking practice in 2021, I do
have a stretch goal of taking my first iTalki lesson with a tutor by end of
year. Once I begin speaking more I know that I will need to practice this skill
a lot, and I think iTalki is going to be a good method for this, so I'd like to
try it out at least once.

Finally, because I'm nerdy, I'm using a JIRA board to build out a studying
"roadmap" for myself to ensure I continue to make progress at the pace I want.
I've mostly planned through the spring, and I'm happy to report that I'm already
a bit ahead of schedule as of this post!

That's all for now. I will report back on progress in the coming weeks/months.
Take care and happy studying! 加油!
