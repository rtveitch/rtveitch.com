  Starting is difficult, but it is also the most important step you'll take

I don't know how many times I have attempted to start, and then ultimately
failed at, writing for a personal blog. I always tell myself that _it'll be
different this time™_, and what follows is a summary of how that usually goes:

1. pick a blog platform or technology
2. endlessly obsess over the technical minutiae
3. decide I have nothing to offer anyone and why did I think this was a good
   idea anyway?
4. more technical details
5. more self doubt
6. park the blog for approximately 6-8 months with the one dummy post I managed
   to upload during the previous five steps
7. repeat

I know this is my habit, my _習慣_ (zaap6 gwaan3). I tend to put in a lot of
energy upfront with respect to a new project, a new pursuit. Every decision must
be carefully considered, every tradeoff analyzed, as if a single mistake will
result in the inevitable unravelling of the entire enterprise. I feel as if this
is ultimately a form of procrastination, or a general fear of failure. Whatever
the cause, it is _exhausting_.

A few months ago, I spoke with a coworker about my problem; that I get really
excited about the prospect of starting something new, but that the actual
getting started part of it was always so difficult. After several more weeks of
on-again-off-again discussion we circled back to this topic, and he informed me
that he coincidentally had been reading a book called
[The Heart to Start](https://www.amazon.com/Heart-Start-Inner-Your-Shine-ebook/dp/B077XRMBR9 "The Heart to Start: Stop Procrastinating & Start Creating"),
and that I really ought to consider giving it a read as well.

**Amazing!**

The author of this book is me! Or rather, _was_ me. His writing on the
difficulty many people have with the just getting on with it of creative work
may as well have been directly sourced from my own personal experience, right
down to the unexpectedly specific Chicago locales referenced in an anecdote
early in the Prologue.

After finishing the remainder of the book, I felt a real desire to get to work.

_So, what work?_

I'm glad you asked.

There are two areas of focus for me at the moment. Firstly, I'm a software
engineer by trade, and although I enjoy working in the profession, I find that
at times I've lost track of why I enjoy programming. I'd like to rediscover that
joy, that fun, and perhaps learn some new things along the way.

Secondly (and perhaps more importantly), I've set an ambitious goal for myself;
I want to speak Cantonese. Why? Well, for a number of reasons. For starters, my
wife's family speaks Cantonese, and I feel a sense of duty to participate in any
capacity that I can. Language and culture are a big part of family. And then
there are the numerous friends I've made who reside in Hong Kong. I feel if they
are doing the heavy lifting by using English all the time, the least I can do is
make a concerted effort to learn Cantonese so that I can reciprocate. There is
also a part of me that is in it for the challenge. I grew up in a monolingual
household; I would love to believe I am capable of speaking another language.
The various polyglots online all say it is possible, and yet, I doubt.

So, what have I done so far and what am I going to do moving forward? For
Cantonese, I've started studying more regularly and intensely than ever before.
I know in order to improve I need to consistently focus. To help keep me
motivated, I've started a
[YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW8MSE_sBSikmoF8xYvp6aw)
where I upload Cantonese learning content. This serves a double purpose in that
it helps my Cantonese, and is also rewarding in its own right. You can also keep
track of my learning progress on the
[Cantonese](https://rtveitch.com/pages/cantonese) page of this blog. I look
forward to writing about my journey as I progress.

Regarding programming, the direction is less clear, and that's ok. Currently I'm
using my Cantonese studying as a driver for programming tasks. For example, I
wanted an easy way to perform bulk dictionary lookups for new words I am
studying in preparation for creating flashcards for review. There were no
existing tools I could find that made this easy for me, so I wrote something
myself. Perhaps through time I will look for interesting small projects such as
this that I can talk about on the blog, and maybe I'll open source some stuff
too.

Finally, the blog. my nemesis. I always knew it would come down to this! I'll
admit that I've been sitting on writing this post for some time, and was well on
my way to step 6. of the pattern I'd established for myself. I'd like to think
I'm going to break the cycle this time, though. I know I will. All I have to do
is remember to not let perfect be the enemy of the good, not let the regrets of
the past or anxiety over the future poison the present moment. Get on with the
getting on with it. Find the heart to start.
